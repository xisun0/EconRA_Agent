# Empirical Economics Skills

A lightweight collection of structured research skills designed to discipline
empirical workflows in applied economics.

This repository does **not** provide code, estimation routines, or automated
analysis. Instead, it formalizes commonly used empirical judgments—about
specification, robustness, and identification—into explicit, reusable
structures.

The goal is not to replace economic reasoning, but to make it more consistent,
transparent, and discussable across projects, coauthors, and stages of research.

## Motivation

Empirical research often fails not because of missing methods or insufficient
data, but because judgment is applied inconsistently:

- baseline specifications change implicitly across drafts,
- robustness checks are added ad hoc rather than systematically,
- identification assumptions are left implicit until challenged by referees.

These issues are rarely about technical competence. They are about how
empirical judgment is organized and communicated.

This repository collects a set of structured "skills" that make such judgments
explicit.

## What this repository is for

Each skill in this repository is a short, self-contained markdown document that
defines:

- its role in the empirical workflow,
- its default assumptions,
- the questions it forces the researcher to answer, and
- the situations in which it should *not* be used.

The skills are intended to support:
- disciplined baseline specification,
- systematic robustness design,
- clearer identification arguments,
- alignment across coauthors,
- structured responses to referee comments.

## What this repository is NOT

- This is **not** a statistical software package.
- It does **not** run regressions or estimate models.
- It does **not** automate causal discovery.
- It does **not** prescribe a single “correct” specification.
- It does **not** aim to be exhaustive or universally applicable.

The skills here discipline judgment; they do not eliminate it.

## How to use this repository

Skills are written as structured markdown documents.
They are meant to be **read and referenced**, not executed.

Typical uses include:
- reviewing a baseline specification before estimation,
- organizing robustness checks in a principled way,
- clarifying identification logic during drafting,
- aligning expectations across collaborators,
- structuring replies to referee concerns.

Researchers are encouraged to adapt, modify, or ignore skills as appropriate
for their specific context.
